Prompt for AI-Powered Personal Stylist & Makeup Recommender

Prompt:

💡 You are an expert AI system architect and full-stack developer.
Design and describe a complete architecture, UI/UX structure, and implementation details for a web-based project called “StyleSense – AI-Powered Personal Stylist & Makeup Recommender”.
The system should use AI, Computer Vision, and AR to analyze the user’s skin tone, face shape, and features and then recommend the most suitable clothing colors, makeup shades, hairstyles, and accessories.
Include all advanced functionalities, page details, database structure, and integration logic.

🧩 1. Project Overview

StyleSense is a full-stack web platform that acts as a virtual stylist.
Users can upload a selfie or use their camera; the AI analyzes their skin tone, undertone, hair color, and face shape, then recommends personalized clothing color palettes, foundation tones, lipstick shades, hairstyles, and accessories.

🧠 3. System Architecture

Frontend (React App):

Handles UI, user interaction, and AR rendering.

Communicates with:

Node.js backend for authentication, data storage, and recommendations.

Python AI microservice for face & tone analysis.

Backend (Node + Express):

REST API handling:

/api/auth → Register/Login

/api/upload → Forward image to AI microservice

/api/recommendations → Fetch personalized color/makeup data

Stores analysis history, user preferences, and palettes in MongoDB.

AI Microservice (Flask / FastAPI):

Receives the image → Uses OpenCV + Mediapipe to detect:

Skin tone (light/medium/dark)

Undertone (cool/warm/neutral)

Face shape (oval, heart, round, etc.)

Eye & hair color

Returns analysis results + tone data to Node.js backend.

Gemini/OpenAI API can then generate human-like fashion advice:

“You have a warm undertone, so pastel green, peach, and gold will suit you best.”

Database (MongoDB):

Collections:

users → name, email, image history

analysis → tone, shape, hair color, results

palettes → predefined color & makeup mappings

history → timestamped recommendation records

🎨 4. Frontend Structure (React Pages)
🔹 Home Page

Hero section with “Try AI Stylist” button

Carousel showing example results

Option to Save Result or Get Makeup Recommendations

🔹 Makeup Recommendation Page

Recommended foundation, lipstick, blush, eyeshadow shades

Each with preview (color block + AR try-on)

“Try AR Mode” button → opens camera to test lipstick shade

Option to view similar products (via dummy data / API)

🔹 Outfit Recommendation Page

Based on detected undertone:

Suggests outfit colors and styles (casual, party, formal, traditional)

Option to filter by occasion

“View Similar Styles” using Gemini-generated text+image pairs

🔹 AI Chat Stylist Page

Chatbot using Gemini/OpenAI API

User can type: “Suggest an outfit for an interview tomorrow”

Bot responds with:

“Based on your warm undertone and oval face, a beige blazer with a maroon top will look elegant.”

🔹 Profile & History Page

Displays user’s saved analyses

Previously suggested makeup and outfit palettes

Option to re-analyze or share results on social media

🧩 5. Advanced Features

🧍‍♀️ Virtual Try-On (AR Mode)

Uses Mediapipe FaceMesh to overlay lipstick, eyeshadow, or blush shades on user’s face in real time.

Implemented with TensorFlow.js + Webcam feed.

💬 AI Fashion Chatbot

Uses Gemini API or OpenAI to generate:

Outfit ideas

Makeup tutorials

Haircare & skincare tips

🎯 Occasion-Based Styling

Dropdown menu: College, Party, Wedding, Interview, Photoshoot

AI adjusts color + makeup suggestions accordingly.

🪞 Personality & Mood Styling

Users can “Add to Wishlist” or “Buy Similar Look”.

🧬 Learning Mode (optional ML extension)

System learns from user likes/dislikes → refines future recommendations (using collaborative filtering or KNN).

🗄️ 6. Database Schema (Simplified)

📊 7. Example Data Flow

User uploads selfie → Frontend sends image to /api/upload.

Backend forwards to Python AI microservice → it returns tone + shape.

Node.js stores analysis in MongoDB.

Node.js queries color/makeup dataset → returns JSON of recommendations.

Frontend renders result page + AR try-on.

Gemini API chatbot uses tone data for personalized advice.
